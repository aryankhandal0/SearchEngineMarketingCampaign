# SearchEngineMarketingCampaign
# Project Description
You work for a digital marketing agency, which is approached by a massive online retailer of furniture. You are tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. With your Python skills, you will efficiently create these keywords!

The most important task in structuring a search engine marketing account is mapping the right keywords to the right ads and making sure they send users to the right landing pages. Having figured that out is a big part of the account setup and makes the life of the account manager much easier.
